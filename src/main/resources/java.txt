Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once,
run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
that support Java without the need to recompile
